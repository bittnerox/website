            The women fellowship is a division under the DCLM {Deeper Christian Life Ministry} of which it involves the spiritual development of the women in the church. The women ministry was first brought to the church by Pastor Kumuyi's first wife, Mrs. Abiodun Kumuyi, in the year 1983. This division under the church was supervised by the late Mrs. Abiodun Kumuyi and is currently being overseen by pastor Kumuyi's second wife {Mrs. Esther Folashade Aduke Blaize}. She also supervises District women coordinators, Zonal women representatives and women house fellowship leaders. Apart from the weekly fellowship meetings which usually hold every sunday evening, there is also a very special monthly programme which holds every first friday of every month. The monthly programme is specially designed to strengthen the spiritual lives of the women. It also incorporates empowerment programmes that can help them meet their domestic and personal needs. The women are usually offered teachings that help them become better wives and mothers at home. They have practical, demonstrative sessions that offer them everything they need to know from housekeeping, child training, cooking tips, health matters, managing the home with careers, business, church responsibilities, leadership mentoring, among others. In addition to the regular meetings, the pastor creates time from his busy schedule to organise special programmes that brings together women from all walks of life. He personally ministers to women during these conferences and camp meetings meant just for the women. In addition, the women secton organises regular outdoor gospel outreaches in form of crusades and street evangelism, aimed at winning women to the lord. The outreach produces wonderful results. A monthly magazine is also published for the women by the General superintendent through the women department known as the women mirror magazine and it is the most circulated christian magazine in Nigeria. It is in high demand by women from all walks of life, christians and non-christians alike. Though the magazine targets women, men have been known to read it as well. In order to meet with the high demand of the magazine, the women section owns a very standard publishing press equipped with modern machines.

           In adhering to the Great commmission to reach to all people groups for christ, Pastor Kumuyi has demonstrated a great love and passion for the children. He understands that the children are part of the never dying souls that Jesus loves and died for and who must be reached with the Gospel. The Children Church as it is popularly known is mandated to teach children the word of God and see that they come into the experience of salvation, sanctification, and Holy Ghost baptism. Interestingly, Pastor Kumuyi himself is directly involved in carrying out this mandate among the children. He finds time from his busy schedule to minister to them from time to time during special programmes organised for them and at the retreats. Apart from having their own auditorium which is well equipped and manned by highly skilled and trained leaders, the children have their own seperate camp during the annual Easter and December Retreats, during which he also ministers to the children. He has created a slot that allows the Children Choir to minister to the entire congregation at the weekly Sunday worship service. As such the children are well integrsted in the ministry. Children in the Deeper Life Bible Church have clear and balanced understanding of the bible and the doctrines of Christ. The teachings and and training they have received have helped them to be godly in the society, among their peers at school and in their neighbourhoods. Many have grown to be very successful professionals as well as leaders and pastors in the Church.

            The work of Pastor Kumuyi started mainly as a ministry towards young people. Right from his conversion as a teacher in Mayflower School, he has been making efforts to reach young people. He organised and led fellowships for students, got involved with the Scripture Union group which has also reached out to students. The teens and youths are the people on whom Pastor Kumuyi expended much of his labour on. Pastor kumuyi started organising the Free Vacation Schools in 1979, these programmes helped students out with some of the difficult subjects they had in schools and taught them proven principles of success. Above all, they were laced with sound and thorough gospel messages that saw so many of these young people give their lives to christ. This programme has continued till date as the Annual National Success Camp. One very distinguishing impact of the youth ministry of Pastor Kumuyi is the raising up of a large assembly of singers known as the Youth Choir. Youths are lovers of music and they need to have the Christian music tailored to their taste, Pastor Kumuyi is also a lover of music. The Youth Choir is one of the largest youth choral groups in any church in Nigeria and Africa. The youth choir has a large orchestra with different types of wind, pipe, and stringed musical instruments. The evangelism thrust of Pastor Kumuyi through the youth ministry has been very successful. The ministry has produced great leaders and workers who are occupying prominent positions both in the church and in the society at large.
